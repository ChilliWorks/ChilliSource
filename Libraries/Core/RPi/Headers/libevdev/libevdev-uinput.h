 * Creation of uinput devices based on existing libevdev devices. These functions
 * help to create uinput devices that emulate libevdev devices. In the simplest
 * form it serves to duplicate an existing device:
 *
 @code
 int err;
 int new_fd;
 struct libevdev *dev;
 struct libevdev_uinput *uidev;
 struct input_event ev[2];

 err = libevdev_new_from_fd(&dev, fd);

 if (uidev < 0)
     return -errno;

 err = libevdev_uinput_create_from_device(dev, uifd, &uidev);
 if (err != 0)
     return err;

 // post a REL_X event
 err = libevdev_uinput_write_event(uidev, EV_REL, REL_X, -1);
 if (err != 0)
     return err;
 libevdev_uinput_write_event(uidev, EV_SYN, SYN_REPORT, 0);
 if (err != 0)
     return err;

 libevdev_uinput_destroy(uidev);
 close(uifd);

 @endcode

 *
 @code
