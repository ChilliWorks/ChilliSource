ChilliSource Change Log
=======================

Version 2.1.3, 2017-
-------------------------
* Fix: Longstanding issue where "Shinniness" was reciprocated (i.e. 1/Shinniness) in Blinn shaders rather than just Shinniness. Note this will affect existing projects.
* Fix: Crash in Collada to CSModel tool if the Collada file has no materials.

Version 2.1.2, 2017-01-26
-------------------------

* Added: Tangents and Bitangents to CSModel format. Accessible in shader vertex declaration as a_tangent and a_bitangent. Model version is now 13. Please rebuild all csmodel files.
* Added: Skybox support via SkyboxComponent and new Skybox material type.
* Added: Gyroscope support for iOS and Android using similar system to Accelerometer.
* Fix: SendToBack in Widget not working properly.

Version 2.1.1, 2017-01-19
-------------------------

* Added: Additional blend modes to materials for destCol and oneMinusDestCol

Version 2.1.0, 2017-01-06
-------------------------
* Added: Support for Cubemaps. Accessed in shaders as u_cubemap[N]. This required changes to the material file formats Texture element to specify a type "Texture" or "Cubemap" and renaming of "image-name" to "file-name".
* Added: Support for stencil buffer (introducing new framebuffer format).
* Added: Support for masking in UI using the stencil buffer (this replaces scissor regions).
* Added: Render to texture support
* Added: New logging macros for formatted logs CS_LOG_XXX_FMT.
* Improved: Added convenience distance method to vector classes.
* Other minor fixes.

Version 2.0.1, 2016-07-21
-------------------------
* Hotfix for issue in GLDynamicMesh where indices were not being assigned correctly on construction

Version 2.0.0, 2016-07-15
-------------------------
* Added: A new multi-threaded renderer. The previous renderer has been completely stripped out and replaced with a brand new renderer which makes much better use of multi-core devices. The new renderer also allows us to add deferred rendering support in the future.
* Added: Small mesh batching. This is a major optimisation which combines small meshes into a single draw call where possible. Currently this only supports dynamic sprites but other mesh types will be added in the future.
* Added: New allocator types, which allow for very efficient allocation of memory.
* Added: An editable label ui widget type.
* Improved: As a result of the changes for the multi-threaded renderer, the main thread is no longer the same as the system/render thread. This thread is now solely for scene management and game logic.
* Improved: The task scheduler has been completely overhauled. It now supports batching of tasks, task depedancies and a number of different task types.
* Improved: The ChilliSource namespaces have been significantly simplified. The sub-namespaces (For example: ChilliSource::Rendering) have been removed and all classes are now located the ChilliSource namespace. An optional CS:: alias is available, and its use is recommened. As a result of this change, some classes have been renamed, for example CSUI::Drawable is now called CS::UIDrawable. 
* Improved: Materials have been improved such that models with different vertex formats (for example static models and animated models) require different materials. The material type system has been simplified down to three types: Unlit, Blinn and Custom.
* Improved: The FileStream API has been significantly improved.
* Improved: Improved the API for manual creation of Textures and Meshes.
* Improved: StaticMeshComponent and AnimatedMeshComponent have been renamed StaticModelComponent and AnimatedModelComponent, and have had their API improved.
* Improved: Updated all systems to support the new threading model. Some minor API changes were required to make this work.
* Improved: Key codes can now request a text description of the key the represent.
* Fixed: Issues with local notifications on Android.
* Fixed: Issues with video subtitles on both Android and iOS.
* Fixed: A problem with keyboard presentation during text entry on Android.
* Removed: Support for custom render sort predicates. This will be re-added in the future.
* Removed: Cubemaps. These will be re-added in the future.
* Removed: Scissor regions. These will be re-added in the future.
* Removed: Render to texture support. This will be re-added soon.
* Removed: Facebook support. This will be re-added soon.
* Removed: Remote notifications on Android.
* Removed: Mesh Batch.
* And many other minor improvements and tweaks that would take too long to list.

* Added: The APK expansion downloader screen can now be overridden by the user.
* Added: Implemented a new, much easier to use system for handling JNI calls on Android. Native to Java calls are now all handled through JavaClass or JavaStaticClass. These include a number of sanity checks and provide more intuitive error messages. Java to Native still works as before.
* Added: Implemented JavaSystem, similar to JavaClass, but specifically for andriod java classes which extend System.
* Added: The android java class FileUtils now includes separate methods for reading and writing binary and text files.

* Improved: Updated the android projects to Android Studio 1.2. This included updating to gradle 1.2.3, build tools version 22.0.1 and sdk version 22.
* Improved: Support for Android Expansion files has been greatly improved. Google Play builds will now be automatically downloaded on startup if not already present. This occurs prior to any game code being executed so the user no longer need to handle the case where game assets do not yet exist. The downloaded expansion file is no longer unpacked meaning the app will be much smaller on disc, and a number of possible complications are avoided. A default downloader screen is provided by the engine.
* Improved: The android file system implementation has been significantly overhauled. Google Play flavoured builds now refer to the main APK expansion file rather than the APK when the Package, ChilliSource or DLC storage locations are requested. Amazon builds still use the APK.
* Improved: Significantly tidied up and improved the android gradle build scripts. 
* Improved: Restructured the Android backend.
* Improved: Renamed the android java class NativeInterface and changed it so that it follows the same lifecycle rules as systems in the native side of the engine.

* Improved: The android manifest builder has been updated to reflect the changes to the Android project structure. Added new option for specifying a custom APK expansion downloader view.
* Improved: The project generator has been updated to include the new Android project structure changes.
* Fixed: A number of inconsistencies and bugs in the Android and Windows FileSystem have been fixed.
* Fixed: A FileStream referring to the Package, ChilliSource or packaged DLC storage locations on Android no longer allows write operations.
* Fixed: A bug where tagged asset paths were incorrectly handled for CkBank resources has been resolved.
* Deprecated: JavaInterface and _JavaInteface are both now deprecated and will be removed in the near future.

Version 1.4.5, 2015-06-26
-------------------------
* Added: Additional data on IAPs can now be retreived through the Android and iOS backends for IAPSystem.
* Fixed: Application and State no longer log a warning if a system couldn't be found using GetSystem<>()
* Fixed: Fixed a number of fatal errors which were incorrectly reported in the PNG To CSImage tool.

* Fixed: The Cricket Audio system, Android Video Player, Android WebView, and Android Email Composer now all work correctly with tagged assets.
* Fixed: An issue in the Content Management System where some packages would re-downloaded unnecessarily.

Version 1.4.2, 2015-05-01
-------------------------
* Added: Label now supports auto sizing to ensure text will fit inside the label bounds
* Fixed: Issues with resolution on iPhone 6 Plus
* Fixed: Changing resolution on windows in code now correctly fires the On Resolution Changed event
