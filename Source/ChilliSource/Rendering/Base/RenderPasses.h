    /// * The base pass. This renders all opaque objects to the scene with only ambient lighting.
    /// * The directional light pass. For each directional light in the scene which doesn't cast
    ///   shadows, a pass over all lit, opaque objects in the scene is performed. This renders the
    ///   applied lighting additively to the base pass and does not write to the depth buffer.
    /// * The directional light shadows pass. For each directional light in the scene which does
    ///   cast shadows, a pass over all lit, opaque objects in the scene is performed. This renders
    ///   the applied lighting additively to the base pass and does not write to the depth buffer.
    /// * The point light pass. For each point light in the scene, a pass over all lit opaque objects
    ///   within the range of influence of the light is performed. This renders the applied lighting
    ///   additively to the previous passes and does not write to the depth buffer.
    /// * The transparent pass. This render all transparent objects in the scene with only ambient
    ///   lighting. The depth buffer is not written to; the objects are first sorted to ensure no
    ///   artefacts occur.
