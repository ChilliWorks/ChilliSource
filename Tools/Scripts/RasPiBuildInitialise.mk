# This copies the required static libraries to the currently built project. 
# The android build settings are also included, so this is the only thing that
# a makefile building a ChilliSource shared library will need to include. 
# 
# Prior to including this, CS_PROJECT_ROOT must be set to the relative path to
# the root of the project, i.e, the directory ChilliSource is located in.
